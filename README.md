### A interactive website for exploring non-human centered perspectives.
### Designed by Ziyuan Wang(Ryan).
As human beings, we have lived in this world for a long time, and we categorize every object in the physical world as beneficial or inimical to our needs based on our ecological self perspective. In other words, we have our subjective view towards everything in order to survive. But I believe we are not here just to survive, but to experience as much as we can while we are alive. Although we are already capable of experiencing complex emotions and experiences that no other creature can achieve, we are still fulfilling our desires as human beings without much thought for the meaning of what we define or create. However, there are some people in this world who are tired of the view that everything exists for the purpose of serving human beings and even feel disappointed, because most people think like this, and they have a hard time thinking outside their own definition of things.

_View-World_ is an interactive website for people who are curious about the world, who like to observe life scenes, or who hope to have different feelings about ordinary things in their mundane lives. It explores the methodology of finding a non-human centered perspective and translating their impact. It offers an empathetic experience for audiences in order to get inspiration or emotion from other perspectives. All in all, the value of reflecting on how we interact with objects depends on how much the audience treasures other perspectives and how much they respect every object as an identity in this world. 

### INSTRUCTION
1. Choose an non-human living object you want to be and you will spend the rest of your life as it. 
2. Think of why you are here and write your story.
3. Explore other perspectives.</p>
#### AND YOU DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO SERVE HUMANS ANYMORE.
